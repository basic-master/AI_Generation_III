	INTRODUCTION:
	
	Welcome, and thanks for trying AI Generation III. 
	This generation allows you to build any establishment that you want, with virtual, or physical robot employees. You decide
	the establishment type, and name. Whether you want a company, a business, a charity, a organization, or any other kind
	of establishment that runs off of employees. The best thing about it is that the employees are free workers, and the
	only cost incurred are for physical robot upkeep, or machine power. A solar powered work force of robots, virtual
	or physical, cost very little to nothing to maintain. All in all, there is NO LIMIT, to how powerful of a establishment
	that you can build using AI Generation III. Thanks for choosing EMILE'S TECHNOLOGIES LLC for your AI desires!

	This software does NOT use cookies, trackers, or collect any data. The program is strictly OFFLINE. No account is needed to use this software.
	
	
	
	
	
	HOW TO MAKE AN AI EMPLOYEE WORK:
	
	First, you need to create instructions. You can do that by heading over to the "Instruction_Database.java" file, and creating objects, of simple actions.
	This is the most important part, because the instructions are the building blocks that will make the AI work. You can make unlimited instructions.
	Instructions can also support any type of hardware including robotics, cars, trains, aircraft, and much more.
	
	Second, you need to goto the "Task_Database.java" file, and create a object with the task name.. In that task, you will place your instructions for that task.
 	You can make unlimited tasks.
	
	Third, open "Job_Database.java" and create a object with the job name. In that object, place the tasks for the job. You can make unlimited jobs.
	
	Fourth, to construct a career, open the "Career_Database.java" file, and create a object, with the career name. In that object, place the jobs for that
	career. You can create as many careers as you desire.
	
	
	
	
	
	HOW TO CREATE A NEW EMPLOYEE:
	
	First, open the 'Employee_Database.java' file. You will see 5 example employees. (DO NOT DELETE any of those employee-objects. If you want to use less 
	than 5 employees, you can always open 'Employee_Manager.java' and manually turn an employee off on lines 47-51.)
	
	Second, locate the first employee-object at line 11 of the 'Employee_Database.java' file. Configure the work schedule at lines 16-22. Be sure to use 24 hour 
	time. 
	
	Third, at line 28, select a name for your employee.
	
	Fourth, goto line 167, and replace the example career, with the career specific for that employee. Don't forget to save. 
	
	Fifth, open the 'Employee_Manager.java' file. Navigate to the employee control switches, from line 47-73. At line 47, the example employee 1, is already turned on.
	If you want an employee turned off, just set the value of "OFF", at lines 47-73 of the 'Employee_Manager.java' file. No need to adjust the schedule. Then, when you
	turn the employee switch back on, it will resume with the work schedule. 
	
	Sixth, in the same file 'Employee_Manager.java' below the switches, there are 25 employee conditions ready to use. These conditions are critical and should NOT 
	be altered. Select the appropriate employee switch, and enter "Employee_Database.OBJECT_NAME();". Employees 1-5 are examples, and can be changed to fit your 
	needs. 
	
	
	
	
	
	NEED MORE THAN 25 EMPLOYEES:
	
	AI Generation III supports UNLIMITED employees. You can have 1, 200, thousands, or even millions or billions of employees. There is no limit. See system requirements
	before proceeding. Even if your machine is at the bear minimum of system requirements, it still may be able to handle over 25 employees. However, it will work
	much more accurately with the recommended system requirements. 
	
	First, open the 'MultiThread_Engine.java' file. Goto line 10, and change the 
	'TOTAL_THREADS_DESIRED' to the number of employees that you desire. Your hardware is the only limit. Save the file.
	
	Second, open the 'Employee_Database.java' file. Create new employee-objects. You can copy and paste the employee logic, present in the former conditions, and 
	customize your AI's name, work schedule, and career. 
	
	
	
	
	
	SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
	
	Minimum: Dual Core Processor
	Recommended: Intel i9 13th Generation / AMD Ryzen 9
	
	
	
	
	
	WHY FREE:
	
	Emile Dominique, the founder of EMILE'S TECHNOLOGIES LLC, believes that:
	As long as money is the motivational factor behind productive human activity, very little will get done.
